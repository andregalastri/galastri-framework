# Galastri Framework

## About
This is a simple PHP 7 microframework created as a study case to develop webapps and websites.

It is a MVC OOP microframework which I started to develop by studing more deeply how PHP works and how to apply design patters with it. My idea is to create a simple framework that is more oriented to people that are starting with MVC, OOP and frameworks in general, but powerful enough to be used in real projects.

**Disclaimer**<br>
This is an early development project. This means that I can drastically change the way the framework works between every commit and without any warn. If you use the framework in real projects, it is a good idea to keep it stick with the version you are using, without updating it. If you do want to update to newer versions, do a backup before and be aware which changes were made.

## Features
- MySQL **Database** class with multiple features like pagination and storing results;
- Easy **routing control** with multiple parameters and configurations;
- Easy way to return data by just setting up which *solver* will be used (View, JSON, File or Text);
- **Redirect** class that can use preconfigured named urls instead of plain urls (easy to change url redirection)
- **Fetch** class that resolves the compatibility issues with $_POST or $_GET globals when using Javascript Promise calls;
- **Authentication** class for protected routes;
- **Permission** class for permission control; 
- Powerful **Validation** class, with multiple options to validate data;
- <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer">PHPMailer</a> for sending emails.
